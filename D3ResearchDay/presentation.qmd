# Motivation: Job Matching in LMICs

- High job attrition is a significant problem in developing country labor markets. (Donovan, Lu, and Schoellman, 2023)
- Job match quality is potentially a key driver. 
- Skill assessments are gaining popularity as a remedy. (Carranza, Garlick, Orkin, and Rankin, 2022)


# Limits of Skill Certifications 


- **Problem:** Even if a candidate scores high on a trait like "grit," the interpretation of that trait can vary by job.
- **Example:** Grit for a computer programmer (resolving bugs) differs from grit needed for a customer service role at a Marriott front desk (angry customer).
- **Solution**: AI finds the best fit for firm (e.g. our partner, Apli)

# Limits of AI

- **Limitation:** Insufficient data on heterogeneity.
- **Example 1:** The best Starbucks barista at an airport may differ significantly from the best√• at a rural drive-thru.
- **Example 2:** A CPG looking for a truck driver needs a good fit with loading partner; stuck together for 8 hours a day!
- **Example 3:** Diverse team needed. Normally Alice is best for the team, but we have many Alices! Need a new Bob to round out the team.

# Potential Solution: Humans!

- **Solution:** Combine AI with human judgment.
- **Background:** Job needs framing, social network referrals
- **Implementation:** Applicant skill assessment supplemented with score of closest and furthest match among manager's current employees.

# Implication: Big Data's Limits

- Alidaee (2023) introduces *context uncertainty* as friction to technology adoption. Rationalizes distrust of big data.
- The issue extends beyond hiring to any application with heterogeneous treatment effects 
- **Takeaway:** Human-in-the-loop is needed to supplement AI in order to improve adoption.


# Literature Review
- External Validity Approaches: Andrews et al (2022); Breza, Chandrasekhar and Viviano (2025); 
- External Validity of Evaluations: Rosenzweig and Uddry (2020); Behejia, Pop-Eleches and Samii (2019)
- Trust of Evidence: Michelson et al. (2021); Berazneva et al (2023); Alsan et al (2025)


# Research Design

- **Pilot Duration:** 3 months
- **Control Group:** Standard AI-based applicant screening.
- **Treatment Group:** Comparative report including:
  - Applicant's score
  - The closest match among current employees
  - The most dissimilar match among current employees
- **Hypothesis:** Treatment will (i) increase use of AI in final hiring decisions and (ii) improve match quality. 


# Data and Empirical Strategy

- **Data Source:** Apli platform records, covering applicant inputs and employee data.
- **Approach:**
  - Employ machine learning techniques to capture heterogeneous treatment effects.
  - Incorporate survey data to shed light on hiring managers' beliefs.
  - Utilize a randomized controlled trial (RCT) framework to derive causal estimates.


# Discussion & Next Steps

- **Current Status:** Preliminary pilot design phase; fundraising
- **Key Open Questions:**
  - Survey design: How to best capture beliefs?
  - Which indicators will most accurately capture improvements in hiring matches?


# Concluding Remarks

- Addressing a critical gap: merge AI with human expertise
- Our approach, inspired by social network referrals, aims to enhance AI interpretability.
- Implications for other areas of technology adoption.
- Concurrent work with Grab on A/B test external validity and Gates on credit risk modeling.
