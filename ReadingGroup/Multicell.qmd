# Background

# Motivation

Traditional experimental design: treatment versus control.

::: incremental
-   [**Can recover Average Treatment Effect on the Treated (ATT)!**]{style="color:green"}
-   [**Cannot recover Marginal Treatment Effect (MTE)**]{style="color:red"}
    -   Less effective for decisions on the intensive margin.
    -   "How many people should I reach with my intervention?"
    -   "How large should my budget be for this intervention?"
    -   **Natural questions for policymakers, not just firms!**

# This paper

::: incremental
-   Experiments with one-sided noncompliance.
-   What fraction of users should be treated among target audience?
-   Use multi-armed experiments to create necessary variation
-   Empirical application: digital ads.

# Firm's Problem

Wants to choose fraction of customers from a target population to treat to maximize profit. Within a segment, customers are observationally equivalent

::: incremental
-   Dual to choosing budget to reach given number of customers.
-   Observational equivalence can be also interpreted as "conditioned on X".
-   Profit can be substituted with cost-effectiveness in development context.
:::

# Firm's Problem - Formalized

For treatment indicator $D$, observed outcome is $$ Y = D Y_1 + (1-D)Y_0.$$

. . .

Profit maximization problem is: $$ \max_{v\in[0,1]} \left( \delta \cdot \left[ v \mathbb{E}[Y\vert D =1] + (1-v)\mathbb{E}[Y\vert D=0]\right] - k(v)\right)$$

# Firm's Problem - Explained

$$ \max_{v\in[0,1]} \left( \delta \cdot \left[ v \mathbb{E}[Y\vert D =1] + (1-v)\mathbb{E}[Y\vert D=0]\right] - k(v)\right)$$

::: incremental
-   $v$ is fraction of customers exposed to treatment
-   $k(v)$ is (expected) cost of treatment. Likely convex and increasing.
-   $\delta$ is constant converting outcomes to monetary terms (i.e. welfare)
-   Expect $k(v)$ and $\delta$ to be known.
-   Need to learn conditional expectations.
:::

# Why do we need MTE?

Recall that MTE($u$) defined as

$$
\mathbb{E}[Y_1 - Y_0 \vert U = u] = \mathbb{E}[Y_1 \vert U = u] - \mathbb{E}[Y_0 \vert U = u]
$$

. . .

So firm problem equal to

$$ \max_{v\in[0,1]} \left( \delta\int_0^v \text{MTE}(u)du  - k(v)\right)$$

# How to Recover Conditional Expectations?

::: incremental
-   Bj√∂rkman and Moffitt (1987) and Heckman and Vytlacil (2005) identify MTE from observational data using a continuous IV.
-   Brinch et al. (2017): Instrument is usually discrete! Showed how to recover polynomial approximation of MTE.

# Experimental Design

# Defining Our Instrument

Let $Z$ indicate whether unit is *eligible* for (randomly assigned) treatment. Then:

$$
D = \unicode{x1D7D9} \{m(Z) \geq U\}.
$$

::: incremental
-   $m(Z)$ governs selection into treatment.
-   $m(Z)$ common conditional on $Z$
-   $U$ is unobservable and heterogeneous
-   Model in line with Heckman et al. (2006)
:::

# Adding Some Structure

Via Mogstad et al. (2018),

**Assumption 1**:

(i) $U \perp\!\!\!\perp Z$ (statistical independence)

(ii) $\mathbb{E}[Y_d \vert Z, U] = \mathbb{E}[Y_d \vert U]$ and $\mathbb{E}[Y_d^2] < \infty$ for $d \in \{0, 1\}$.

(iii) $U$ is continuously distributed

(i)-(ii) imply $Z$ exogenous and valid instrument.

\(iii\) allows normalizing $U \sim U(0, 1)$.

## What about monotonicity?

Vytlacil (2002) shows:

Given **statistical independence** $(U \perp\!\!\!\perp Z)$,

Monotonicity assumption of Imbens and Angrist (1994)

$$
\Longleftrightarrow
$$

Index of selection is additively separable as in $$
D = \unicode{x1D7D9} \{m(Z) - U \geq 0\}.
$$

# Defining a Propensity Score

With Assumption 1, we can define probability of treatment given eligibility:

$$
m(Z) = \Pr (D=1 \vert Z).
$$

$D$ and $Z$ are observed, so $m(\cdot)$ can be straightforwardly estimated.

# Single-Cell Experimental Design Insufficient

![](single_cell_Design.svg){fig-align="center" width="180" height="180"}

. . .

One-sided noncompliance $\Rightarrow$

LATE = ATT $\equiv$ $\mathbb{E}[Y_1 - Y_0 \vert D = 1]$

. . .

But ATT doesn't help with our intensive margin decision!

# An Alternative Design

::: incremental
-   Randomly assign each individual to one of $C$ cells

-   Split each cell individually into treatment versus control

-   $Z_c$ is now indicator for treatment eligibility of an individual in cell $C$

-   One-sided non-compliance: $\Pr(D=1 \vert Z_c = 0) = 0$ for all $c$

-   Equivalent to randomly allocating some to single control cell and others to one of $C$ cells where all of latter eligible for treatment.
:::

# A few more assumptions

**Assumption 2**:

(i) $\Pr(Z_c = z \vert \mathcal{C} = c) \in (0, 1) \forall c, z$

(ii) $m(Z_c = 1) \equiv \Pr(D = 1 \vert Z_c = 1) \in (0, 1) \forall c$

(iii) $m(Z_c = 1) \neq m(Z_{c'})$ for all $c \neq c'$

. . .

\(i\) and (ii) innocuous.

. . .

\(iii\) ensures variation in treatment probabilities across cells.

# How do we ensure variation?

::: incremental
-   Change per capita budget for outreach across cells
-   Vary incentives for enrollment across cells
-   Example: for online ads, vary bid price for ad space across cells
-   Example: for development, vary number of SMS reminders across cells
:::

# What do we learn?

Data about MTE function captured in $2C + 1$ moments:

$$\phi_{dzc} \equiv \mathbb{E}[Y \vert D = d, Z_c = z_c, \mathcal{C} = c]$$

::: incremental
-   Each non-parametrically identified
-   Each moment equal to $\mathbb{E}[Y_d \vert U \geq m(z_c), Z_c = z_c]$
-   Each instrument $Z$ has $C$ values, one per propensity score
-   Can recover MTE using polynomial approximation
-   Assume polynomial with degree $C - 1$
-   Lots of notation. Read paper for details.
:::

## Why not $3C$ moments?

Recall $m(Z_c = 0) = 0$ for all $c$.

. . .

Thus,

$$
\begin{aligned}
\phi_{00c} &= \mathbb{E}[Y \vert D = 0, Z_c = 0, \mathcal{C} = c] \\
&= \mathbb{E}[Y_0 \vert U > 0, Z_c = 0] \\
&\equiv \phi_{00}
\end{aligned}
$$

. . .

Only one moment for all unexposed!

## What is being approximated?

Define marginal treatment response (MTR) $r_d(u)$ as 
$$
\begin{aligned}
\mathbb{E}[Y_1 \vert U \leq v] &= \int_0^v \mathbb{E}[Y_1 \vert U = u] \cdot \frac{1}{v} du \\
&\equiv \int_0^v r_1(u) \frac{1}{v} du \\
\mathbb{E}[Y_0 \vert U > v] &= \int_v^1 r_0(u) \cdot \frac{1}{1-v} du \\
\end{aligned}
$$
So $\text{MTE}(u) = r_1(u) - r_0(u)$ and can define $\phi_{dzc}$ via $r_d(u)$.

$r_d(u)$ can be approximated by order $C$ polynomials with experimental moments. 

# Evaluation

::: incremental
- No actual multi-cell experiment done
- Create synthetic data to calibrated to single-cell experiment in Gordon et al. (2019)
- Evaluate how well they can recover synthetic DGP
- Assume DGP is cubic but only use two-cell experiment
- Evaluate MTE estimation using variety of norms
- Perform very well!
